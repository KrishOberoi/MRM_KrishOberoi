For the Task 3, I downloaded the Employee.csv file into my local system and then saved it in csv format inside my GitHub_Task folder. Then I used the linux command $git add . to add that file so as to bring it to the staging area, then $ git commit -m "Second commit" was used. After this, $ git branch -M main and then followed by $ git pull origin main and then $ git push origin main.X
